BURG Custom Icons
=================
-------------------
#### Repository of additional icons for missing operating systems and linux distrobutions.

Link to my tutorial on creating custom burg icons: [Cusotmize BURG Boot Loader](https://coombesy.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/customize-burg-boot-loader/)

With the consistent release of linux distributions, propietary versions and also- operating systems I'm only finding out about - rebooting to check out the newly installed distro and finding the `?` icon in burg is starting to bug me.


<ul>note:</ul> Absolutely no attempt is made, yet, to get icon's looking nice. I'm not a graphic designer but if you are and have some icons to contribute then please do ;)

<u>also...:</u> these icons will be built for the [fortune theme](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Fortune+-+BURG+Theme?content=128929)

<u>also note:</u>
 - The `linuxmint` icons, and a lot of the ground work, from this tutorial: [ubuntuhandbook.org - beautiful-boot-menu-burg-ubuntu](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/02/beautiful-boot-menu-burg-ubuntu/)
 - bohdi icon comes from here: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Linux

##Installation

place the contents of the `custom` directory in this repo in `/boot/burg/themes/custom/`

You may need to run:
```
$ sudo update-burg
```

then check everything works with:
```
$ burg-emu
```

####Roadmap:
 - do custom icons
 - (maybe a .deb installer?)
 - do custom theme
