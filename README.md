BURG Custom Icons
=================
-------------------
#### Repository of additional icons for missing operating systems and linux distrobutions.


With the consistent release of linux distributions, propietary versions and also- operating systems I'm only finding out about - rebooting to check out the newly installed distro and finding the `?` icon in burg is starting to bug me.

For now, though, its just a pointlessly empty repo... again ;)

<u>note</u>: these icons will be built for the [fortune theme](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Fortune+-+BURG+Theme?content=128929)

<u>also note</u>:
 - The `linuxmint` icons, and a lot of the ground work, from this tutorial: [ubuntuhandbook.org - beautiful-boot-menu-burg-ubuntu](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/02/beautiful-boot-menu-burg-ubuntu/)

---------------

##Installation

place the contents of the `custom` directory in this repo in `/boot/burg/themes/custom/`

You may need to run:
```
$ sudo update-burg
```

then check everything works with:
```
$ burg-emu
```

####Roadmap:
 - do custom icons
 - (maybe a .deb installer?)
 - do custom theme
